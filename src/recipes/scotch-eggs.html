  <h1>Scotch Eggs</h1>
  <p>
    Scotch eggs are soft-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and bread crumbs,<br>
    deep-fried for a delicious savory treat. They're a British pub favorite,<br>
    perfect for family occasions or picnics.<br>
    We like to make these on Christmas Eve served on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes and mustard for garnish.
